# Task Manager

A modern, lightweight task management web application designed to help users organize daily responsibilities, stay productive, and monitor progress through a clean and responsive interface.

## Overview

Task Manager is a frontend-focused productivity app that allows users to manage tasks, review their workload from different perspectives, and keep everything organized without relying on any backend service. All data is stored locally in the browser using LocalStorage, ensuring a fast and private experience.

## Key Features

- Create, edit, complete, and delete tasks
- Organize tasks through a structured task-based interface
- View tasks in multiple perspectives such as calendar and matrix views
- Explore progress through an analytics-oriented dashboard
- Customize the experience with settings and theme support
- Maintain personal data locally for fast access and privacy

## Project Goals

This project was developed to demonstrate:

- modular frontend architecture
- clean separation of concerns
- browser-based persistence
- responsive UI design
- practical task-management workflows

## Technology Stack

- Vite
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Custom CSS styling
- Font Awesome
- LocalStorage for persistence
- Feature-based frontend modularity

```

## Architecture

The application follows a structured frontend architecture based on clear separation between presentation, behavior, and state:

- `app/` — application bootstrap and global configuration
- `components/` — reusable UI blocks and feature-specific modules
- `controllers/` — event handling and workflow coordination
- `models/` — application state and persistence layer
- `services/` — reusable business logic and side-effect abstractions
- `views/` — page-level rendering and visual composition

This organization improves maintainability, readability, and extensibility while preserving a lightweight implementation.

## Demo
